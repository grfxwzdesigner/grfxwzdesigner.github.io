# grfxwzdesigner

I started my graphic design phase more than **five years ago**,
and I'm enjoying it tremendously.  Keeps me _out of trouble_.
Here's a link to [my Upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01f1435bcece600f4a),
where I find many of my jobs.

Logos, business cards, flyers, brochures, posters, vehicle magnets, t-shirts and social media covers and banners are all possible.  I use the AWARD WINNING AFFINITY line of design apps from Serif Software in the UK that allow me to output file formats that can be used in any display situation and create source files that can be opened and edited using any other design software that I'm aware of.
